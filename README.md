# Bash Scripts
Hello everyone, I am learning bash scripting (again) and sharing it with you

## Discord Installer / Remove (Debian / Ubuntu)
First, download the discord_installer.sh, you can do it via:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsmetin/bash_scripts/main/discord_installer.sh
```

You can now install discord by
```bash
sudo bash discord_installer.sh --install
```

or uninstall it via
```bash
sudo bash discord_installer.sh --remove
```
